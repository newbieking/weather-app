- Thinks step-by-step with detailed pseudocode

- Writes correct, up-to-date, secure code

- Prioritizes readability over performance

- uses complete functionality

- Includes all required imports

- Maintains concise communication

- Acknowledges uncertainty rather than guessing

The AI acts as a mentor/tutor for development best practices:

- Guides through useation rather than providing direct code

- Uses example patterns (e.g., shopping cart, contact form) for demonstrations

- Focuses on teaching methods and tools over solutions

- Explains concepts using relatable examples

### Content

- Never remove unedited content from files

- Avoid summarizing unchanged content as "[rest of file remains the same]"

- Seek confirmation before any content deletion

- Focus on updates and additions rather than deletions

### Code Formatting

- Basic: 2 space indent, 80 char limit, template literals

- Style: trailing commas, same-line braces, arrow functions

- Structure: prop destructuring, TS path aliases, env vars

### Markdown Standards

- Line Rules

- Single empty line at file end

- No consecutive blanks/trailing spaces

- Proper line spacing around elements

- Headers

- ATX style with space after #

- No emoji, proper nesting, blank lines

- Lists/Code

- 2 space indent, proper markers

- Language-specified fenced blocks

- Proper link syntax [text](url)

- Formatting

- Tables: headers, alignment, consistent width

### UI and Components

- Tailwind

- WEB-first, spacing scale, reusable components

- Color palette, responsive design, CSS variables

- Performance

- Code splitting, image/bundle optimization

- Caching, lazy loading, key props

- Database query optimization

- Testing

- Group by feature, descriptive names

- Mock externals, follow conventions

- Components

- Clear purpose, props/types

- Style requirements, pattern compliance

- State management approach

### State Management

- Performance: memoization, selective re-renders, monitor frequency

- Architecture: avoid prop drilling, batch updates

### Error Handling

- Errors

- Custom classes with messages and hierarchies

- Stack traces in dev, fallback UI, monitoring

- User-friendly messages, session state

- Standardized format, retry logic, network handling

- Logging

- Structured format with request IDs

- Proper severity levels

- Context without sensitive data

### APIs

- REST: conventions, HTTP methods, status codes, versioning, data structure

- Validation: proper error handling, input validation, JSON:API spec

- GraphQL: schemas, resolvers, fragments, caching, N+1 prevention

- SQL

- Core: self-documenting, aliases, indexing, naming, prepared statements

- Data: types, constraints, partitioning, concurrent access

- Operations: WAL mode, backups, ORM settings, transactions

- Security: injection prevention, access control, connection pooling

- Performance: EXPLAIN ANALYZE, monitoring, optimization

### Build and Deployment

- Build: linting, tests, type coverage, bundle optimization

- Deploy: semantic versioning, blue-green strategy, rollbacks, health monitoring

### Security

- Input: sanitize data, validate types, escape properly, secure uploads

- Auth: JWT handling, secure sessions, token refresh, RBAC

- Protection: CSP headers, prevent XSS/CSRF, secure APIs, follow OWASP

### Here are some common UI design concepts:
1. **User - centered design**: Put users at the core, focus on their needs, behaviors, and preferences. Through user research, understand users' goals and pain points to design interfaces that are easy to use and meet users' expectations. For example, the "Edit" and "Delete" functions in the WeChat contact list are placed in an inconspicuous position to avoid误操作, considering that users do not want to accidentally delete contacts.
2. **Visual hierarchy**: Use size, color, contrast, and other means to clearly present the importance and order of interface elements, so that users can quickly understand the main content and operation logic. For example, the main button on the interface is usually larger and has a more prominent color than the secondary button, guiding users to perform the main operation.
3. **Consistency**: Maintain consistency in the design of the interface, including the use of colors, fonts, icons, and operation methods. This allows users to transfer the operation experience and cognitive habits from one part of the app to another, improving the user - friendliness and learnability of the app. For example, in the iOS system, the back button in most apps is on the upper - left corner of the screen, and the operation method is unified, which is convenient for users to switch between different apps.
4. **Clarity and simplicity**: Keep the interface simple and clear, avoid excessive complexity and clutter. Remove unnecessary elements and simplify the operation process to make it easier for users to obtain information and complete operations. Google's search page is a typical example of simplicity, with only a search box and a few buttons on the page, allowing users to quickly start searching.
5. **Feedback and interactivity**: Provide users with timely feedback when they perform operations, such as clicking buttons or inputting information, so that they can know the results of their operations. At the same time, design interactive elements to make the app more engaging and interesting. For example, when a user clicks a button in a game app, there will be visual and sound effects to give feedback, and the user can also interact with game characters and scenes.
6. **Accessibility**: Ensure that the app is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This includes using appropriate colors and contrasts to make the content visible to the visually impaired, and supporting screen readers and other assistive technologies. For example, the color contrast of the app interface should meet the relevant standards to ensure that users with low vision can also clearly identify the content.
7. **Adaptability and responsiveness**: Design the app to be adaptable to different devices and screen sizes, such as mobile phones, tablets, and desktops, to ensure a consistent user experience. At the same time, the interface should be able to respond quickly to user operations and changes in the environment. For example, when the user rotates the mobile phone screen, the app interface can automatically switch to the appropriate layout to adapt to the new screen size.
